OIDC (Open ID Connect) - This is for AUTHENTICATION (Getting User Information) and is an extension to OAuth2.0

What does OpenID Connect Add to OAuth2.0?

    - ID TOKEN: (Has info about the user but not their authorization levels).
    - USERINFO: An endpoint for getting more user information if the stuff in the ID Token isn't enough. 
    - Standard set of scopes.
    - Standardised Implementation.

In summary, if there is an AUTHORISATION SERVER that supports both OAuth2.0 and OIDC, you can get both an ID Token to 
identify the user and an ACCESS TOKEN to see what the user is allow to see and do.

OpenID Connect uses the AUTHORISATION CODE FLOW/GRANT TYPE but the SCOPE is 'openid' which tells the AUTHORISATION SERVER that the 
client needs an AUTHORISATION CODE that can later be swapped for an ID TOKEN and ACCESS TOKEN with the AUTHORISATION SERVER. 
The ACCESS TOKEN is used to get more information about the user from the USER INFO endpoint. 

OpenID Connect supports both AUTHORISATION CODE FLOW (for ID TOKENS and ACCESS TOKENS using an AUTHORISATION CODE) via back channels 
and IMPLICIT FLOW (ID TOKEN or ACCESS TOKEN without and AUTHORISATION CODE) via the front channel. 

THE ID TOKEN in a 'Java Web Token' or JWT or pronounced 'JOT'. 

MORE ON AUTHORISATION GRANTS:
-----------------------------

    AUTHORISATION CODE FLOW (CODE FLOW): Front channel + back channel (when both are available)

    IMPLICIT FLOW: Front channel only (when we need just then token and no back channel is available)
        'Just give the token, ignore code'. Examples - SPA in React apps where there is no backend server. 
        Would use RESPONSE_TYPE=token
        Not as secure as the token is exposed to the browser
